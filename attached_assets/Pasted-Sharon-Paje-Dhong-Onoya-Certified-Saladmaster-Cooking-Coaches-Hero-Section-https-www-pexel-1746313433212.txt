Sharon and Dhong have been authorized Saladmaster distributors (Trinity4Health) since 2020, serving the Santa Clarita community and beyond. Together they bring years of experience in nutrition and home cooking, helping families prepare healthy meals with professional quality cookware. As certified Saladmaster coaches, they conduct interactive cooking classes (“cooking shows”) in your home or virtually, demonstrating how to use 316Ti stainless Saladmaster pots and pans for maximum flavor and nutrition. They emphasize an educational, community-driven approach: friendly guidance, practical tips, and a focus on eating well. Sharon and Dhong are approachable experts who answer questions on the spot, building trust and enthusiasm. Their personal story (partners since 2020) and local roots make them relatable guides. With every demo, they showcase real-life success stories and teach families how to cook smarter, not harder – all aligned with the Saladmaster vision of healthful, long-lasting cookware.
Health Benefits of Saladmaster Cookware

Cooking with Saladmaster’s waterless technology yields real health benefits. In fact, a University of Wisconsin Food Science study found that food cooked in Saladmaster cookware retains up to 93% of its nutrients
fully-alive.net
 – far more than conventional methods. Because Saladmaster pots trap steam and cook at lower temperatures, vitamins and minerals stay in the food instead of boiling away. Another clinical trial showed that waterless stainless cooking significantly increased blood vitamin C and β-carotene levels, and even reduced oxidized LDL (“bad” cholesterol)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In short, you get more of the healthful antioxidants and nutrients from your vegetables and proteins. Unlike nonstick or aluminum pans, Saladmaster uses pure 316Ti stainless steel – no synthetic coatings or toxins. There is no PTFE/PFAS (Teflon) on these pots, so you avoid the harmful “forever chemicals” linked to cholesterol and cancer risk

. (Recent research has highlighted PFAS as a serious issue: e.g. PFOA is classified a possible carcinogen
ecocenter.org
.) Saladmaster also contains no heavy metals leaching into food
fully-alive.net
, making it ideal for families who want truly non-toxic cookware. Overall, studies and experts agree: cooking with waterless stainless (like Saladmaster) delivers healthier meals. You can sauté, steam, and even low-fry with almost no oil, preserving natural flavor without added fat. Sharon and Dhong highlight these science-backed benefits in every demo, citing the UW nutrient study

pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
 and explaining how Saladmaster’s design (Vapo-Valve™ and semi-vacuum) locks in flavor and vitamins.
